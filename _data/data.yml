career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My current day to day activities involves contacting project teams and introduce 
      them in performance engineering and service virtualization, initially gathering 
      all information possible using questionnaires, meetings and understanding requirements 
      for documentation and scripting, test executions and analysis of all types of 
      load tests and working with teams on application monitoring during performance test 
      executions. 

      Also developing virtual services for increasing performance testing scope or removing 
      problematic data sources to validate project health. I have experience implementing CI/CD 
      for performance testing using Jenkins and Jmeter for inhouse and cloud applications, 
      as well as environment configuration through Jenkins for test executions.
